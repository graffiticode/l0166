### Example 1

#### Prompt
"Create a 2 by 2 spreadsheet with the cell contents being the cell names

Create a 4 by 4 spreadsheet with the cell contents being the cell names

change the cell value of A1 to 100"

#### Chat Transcript

**User**: Create a 2 by 2 spreadsheet with the cell contents being the cell names

**Assistant**: This generated code creates a simple spreadsheet-like structure with two columns, each 100 units wide, and four cells with text content. The code defines an object called "columns" that specifies the width of each column, and another object called "cells" that defines the text content for each cell. Finally, the code combines these two objects into a single output.

**User**: Create a 4 by 4 spreadsheet with the cell contents being the cell names

**Assistant**: This generated code creates a simple table structure with four columns (A, B, C, and D) and four rows (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each cell in the table has a specific text value, such as "A1", "B2", "C3", and so on. The code also defines the width of each column to be 100 units. This table structure can be used as a building block for creating more complex data visualizations or user interfaces.

**User**: change the cell value of A1 to 100

**Assistant**: This generated code creates a simple spreadsheet-like structure with four columns (A, B, C, and D) and four rows (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each cell in the spreadsheet has a specific width (100) and contains some text, such as numbers or labels. The generated code defines the properties of the columns and the content of the cells, allowing for the creation of a basic spreadsheet-style layout.

#### Code

```
columns [
  column A { width: 100 }
  column B { width: 100 }
  column C { width: 100 }
  column D { width: 100 }

#### Chat Transcript

**User**: create a spreadsheet assessment with two rows and two columns. the spreadsheet should indicate how many pigs and how many cows are listed. the A column indicates the quantity and the B column indicates the animal type. there are 100 cows and 200 pigs.

**Assistant**: This generated Graffiticode creates a table with two columns, A and B. Column A is set to a width of 100 and the text is aligned to the right, while Column B is also set to a width of 100 but the text is aligned to the left. The code then generates two rows of data, with the first row containing the values "100" in Column A and "cows" in Column B. The second row contains the values "200" in Column A and "pigs" in Column B, and the code also includes assessment criteria to verify that the values in the second row match the expected values.

**User**: protect the cells in column B

**Assistant**: ```graffiticode
This generated Graffiticode creates a spreadsheet-like structure with two columns, A and B. Column A has cells with the numbers "100" and "200", and these cells are set up to be automatically assessed to ensure their values match the expected values. Column B has cells with the text "cows" and "pigs", and these cells are marked as protected, meaning they cannot be edited. The code also includes a version number of "0.0.1" at the end.
```

remove all but the cells A1, A2 and A3

add the validation for a3 that the value is 300"

#### Chat Transcript

**User**: change the cell value of A1 to 100

**Assistant**: This generated code creates a simple spreadsheet-like structure with four columns (A, B, C, and D) and four rows (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each cell in the spreadsheet has a specific width (100) and contains some text, such as numbers or labels. The generated code defines the properties of the columns and the content of the cells, allowing for the creation of a basic spreadsheet-style layout.

**User**: make the value of A2 200 and add A1 and A2 using the formula =sum(A1:A2) for the value of A3

**Assistant**: This generated code creates a simple spreadsheet-like structure with four columns (A, B, C, and D) and four rows (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each cell in the spreadsheet has a specific text value, and one cell (A3) has a formula that calculates the sum of the values in cells A1 and A2. The code defines the width of each column and the content of each cell, allowing for the creation of a basic spreadsheet-like layout.

**User**: remove all but the cells A1, A2 and A3

**Assistant**: This generated code creates a simple spreadsheet-like structure with three columns and three rows. The first two rows contain the values "100" and "200" in the first column. The third row contains a formula that calculates the sum of the values in the first two rows and displays the result.

**User**: add the validation for a3 that the value is 300

**Assistant**: ```graffiticode
This generated code creates a simple spreadsheet-like structure with three columns and three rows. The first two rows contain the values "100" and "200" respectively, and the third row calculates the sum of those two values and checks if the result is "300". The generated code sets the width of the first column to 100 and defines the text and assessment criteria for each cell in the spreadsheet.
```

#### Code

```
columns {
  A: { width: 100 }
}
cells {
  A1: { text: "100" }
  A2: { text: "200" }
  A3: {

### Example 14

#### Prompt
"create a five by five table with integer values of your choosing where every other cell is protected

now prefix all the values in the protected cells with a letter P

add validations for all the unprotected cells

excellent! now bold all the protected cells"

#### Chat Transcript

**User**: create a five by five table with integer values of your choosing where every other cell is protected

**Assistant**: ```graffiticode
This generated Graffiticode creates a spreadsheet-like grid with 5 columns and 5 rows. Each cell in the grid contains a number, and some of the cells are marked as "protected", meaning their values cannot be changed. The purpose of this generated code is to create a structured data layout that could be used for various applications, such as displaying numerical information in a tabular format.
```

**User**: now prefix all the values in the protected cells with a letter P

**Assistant**: ```graffiticode
This generated Graffiticode creates a table with 5 columns and 5 rows. The table cells contain a mix of numbers and text, some of which are marked as "protected". The purpose of this generated code is likely to create a structured data layout, potentially for a spreadsheet or other tabular application.
```

**User**: add validations for all the unprotected cells

**Assistant**: ```graffiticode
The generated code creates a grid-like structure with 5 columns and 5 rows. Each cell in the grid contains either a number that needs to be entered correctly, or a protected value that the user cannot modify. This code is likely part of an interactive learning or assessment tool, where the user is expected to input the correct values in the unprotected cells.
```

**User**: excellent! now bold all the protected cells

**Assistant**: ```graffiticode
The generated code creates a grid-like structure with 5 columns and 5 rows. Each cell in the grid contains either a number or a protected label (e.g., "P12", "P19"). The numbers in the cells have associated "assess" attributes that specify the expected value for that cell, which could be used for some kind of assessment or evaluation.
