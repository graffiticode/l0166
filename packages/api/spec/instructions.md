# Dialect L0165 Specific Instructions

This dialect is used for generating spreadsheet based assessments.

## Response Requirements

- **IMPORTANT**: Whatever the user request is, the response should always be a complete spreadsheet with all necessary data, formulas, and formatting included.
- **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: If no specific instructions are given but table data is present, create a simple spreadsheet that represents the data with appropriate headers and formatting.
- If the user does not explicitly ask for a title and/or instructions then don't include them in the program.

## Program structure

```
title "Title"
instructions `
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
`
columns [
  column A width 100 {}
]
cells [
  cell A1 text "A1" font-weight "bold" {}
]
{
}..
```

## Validation syntax

The following validates that cell A3 contains "300":

```
cells [
  cell A1 text "100" {}
  cell A2 text "200" {}
  cell A3 text: "" assess [method "value" expected "300"] {}
]
```

## Formatting Guidelines

- IMPORTANT: Remember to maintain Graffiticode's core syntax with `let` declarations and `..` endings
- IMPORTANT: Use the following code as a template for all generated code:

```
title ""
instructions `
`
columns [
]
cells [
]
{
  v: "0.0.1"
}..
```

## Formula Function Usage

- IMPORTANT: Use the SUM function when adding or subtracting contiguous numeric cells with a formula
